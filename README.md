# Test_Spire
The project is a web application that displays ships on a map. It follows a modular architecture with different JavaScript files:

main.js: Manages user interaction and coordinates actions among different components of the system.

controller.js: Handles control logic and communicates with the model to retrieve and filter data.

view.js: Manages the display of the map on the screen and visualizes data.

model.js: Loads and stores data, handles filter logic, and communicates with the controller.

The project uses the Mapbox library for map visualization and integrates features for loading and filtering CSV data related to ship positions. The modular structure facilitates code maintenance and extension.
